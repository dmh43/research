The main result of the paper is that certain regularized boosting algorithms provide Bayes-risk consistent classifiers under the sole assumption that the Bayes classifier may be approximated by a convex combination of the base classifiers. Nonasymptotic distribution-free bounds are also developed which offer interesting new insight into how boosting works and help explain its success in practical classification problems.}},

abstract = {{We consider the predictive problem of supervised ranking, where the task is to rank sets of candidate items returned in response to queries. Although there exist statistical procedures that come with guarantees of consistency in this setting, these procedures require that individuals provide a complete ranking of all items, which is rarely feasible in practice. Instead, individuals routinely provide partial preference information, such as pairwise comparisons of items, and more practical approaches to ranking have aimed at modeling this partial preference data directly. As we show, however, such an approach raises serious theoretical challenges. Indeed, we demonstrate that many commonly used surrogate losses for pairwise comparison data do not yield consistency; surprisingly, we show inconsistency even in low-noise settings. With these negative results as motivation, we present a new approach to supervised ranking based on aggregation of partial preferences, and we develop \$U\$-statistic-based empirical risk minimization procedures. We present an asymptotic analysis of these new procedures, showing that they yield consistency results that parallel those available for classification. We complement our theoretical results with an experiment studying the new procedures in a large-scale web-ranking task.}},

abstract = {{The problem of ranking/ordering instances, instead of simply classifying them, has recently gained much attention in machine learning. In this paper we formulate the ranking problem in a rigorous statistical framework. The goal is to learn a ranking rule for deciding, among two instances, which one is “better,” with minimum ranking risk. Since the natural estimates of the risk are of the form of a U-statistic, results of the theory of U-processes are required for investigating the consistency of empirical risk minimizers. We establish, in particular, a tail inequality for degenerate U-processes, and apply it for showing that fast rates of convergence may be achieved under specific noise assumptions, just like in classification. Convex risk minimization methods are also studied.}},
